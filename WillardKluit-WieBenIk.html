<!-- Edit this part at a later date -->
			<b>My name is Willard Kluit. I am an aspiring programmer, currently studying application development at the <a href="https://www.davinci.nl/">Davinci College</a>. I am 18 years old and am currently living in Dordrecht, the Netherlands.<br>
			Ultimately, my goal is to gather as much knowledge as I need to develop new and innovative applications. This is something I've always been interested in, and have experimented with on numerous occasions in the past.<br>
			To have the possibillity to create something new from scratch is something that I've always been fascinated by, and with code this is possible.<br>
			Under ideal circumstances I'd love to find a way of combining the coding skills I will acquire over the course of my education with my other hobbies and interests, namely PC gaming, military aviation and history.<br>
			At this point my skills are quite rudimentary, having dabbled in Python in the past and a very limited amount of HTML.<br>
			I would however like to hone and expand these skills, in an effort to set myself up for a succesful career as a developer. After doing some research I've developed an interest in Ruby, and subsquently Ruby on Rails. This is however not the most commonly used language, so PHP is something I will need as well. As these are backend languages, SQL will also be a requirement for me. While I would likely focus on backend development, knowledge of both HTML and CSS for frontend implementation is also something I want to acquire since it allows for greater versatility and variation in day to day work, even if it will likely not be my specialty, even if I have more of an interest in backend development.<br>
			<br>
			In my personal life I'm an avid gamer, which automatically gives me a fairly extensive knowledge of general PC functionality.<br>
			This has proven useful in improving my skills so far. It has also given me an advantage in my linguistic skills, honing my English to an extent where I'm not afraid to claim I'm fluent in it. Online gaming also put me in touch with a lot of people around the world, allowing me to get a feel for interaction with many different cultures.<br>
			Over time I've developed an extensive vocabulary, both in English and my native Dutch. This allows me to make a professional impression in both languages.<br>
			I've done some translating work for companies in the past, so even in a business environment my English has proven useful. </b>
